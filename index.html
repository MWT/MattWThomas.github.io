    I'm Matthew Wildrick Thomas, an Economics PhD candidate at Northwestern University. I am currently interested in
    applied microeconomic theory including information in financial markets, contests, and lobbying. This page is here
    to share my <a href="#academic">academic</a> and  <a href="#non-academic">non-academic</a> projects.
